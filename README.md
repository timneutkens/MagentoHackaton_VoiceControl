# Magento 2 VoiceControl
Control the Magento frontend with your voice

To trigger the voice control use: `ctrl + m`

Available commands:

* Go to homepage
* Next page
* Previous page
* Search for <what you want to search for>

Webshops usually don't get to talk that much. So maybe ask how the Magento is doing..?

## Installation

Install using composer:

`composer require 'magentohackaton/voicecontrol'`
